#  IPL Team Points Forecastingüèè
The goal of this module is to forecast the total points of IPL teams based on historical match data, team performance trends, and various influencing factors such as player statistics, match conditions, and opposition strength.

# Project Overviewüìä
This project aims to analyze IPL data from multiple seasons, build predictive models for runs scored, and deploy the model via a user-friendly interface. It includes detailed data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and advanced modeling.
