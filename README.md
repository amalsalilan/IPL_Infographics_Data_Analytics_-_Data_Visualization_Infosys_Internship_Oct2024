## Introduction

**IPL Infographics: Data Analytics & Data Visualization**

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a globally renowned Twenty20 cricket tournament held annually in India. This project involves performing comprehensive data analysis, predictive modeling, and creating insightful visualizations based on IPL data. Our aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform stakeholders and enthusiasts about various aspects of the tournament.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights into player performances, team trends, and venue statistics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict in-game scores, match winners, and forecast player performance.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive and informative visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- **Collaboration**: Leverage the strengths of individual team members through branch-specific contributions.

---

## Project Structure

Due to the collaborative nature of this internship project, the repository is organized with multiple branches:

- **Main Branch**: Contains the consolidated project with all functionalities and final deliverables.
- **Intern Branches**: Individual contributions are available in sub-branches named after each intern.

---

## Use Cases

The project addresses three primary use cases:

1. **Predicting In-Game Score**
   - **Approach**: Regression analysis.
   - **Best Models**: Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression.

2. **Predicting the Winner**
   - **Approach**: Classification algorithms.
   - **Models Used**: Various machine learning classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).

3. **Forecasting Player Performance**
   - **Approach**: Time series forecasting.
   - **Model Used**: ARIMA model (suitable for datasets with fewer data points).

---

## Modules Implemented

The project is divided into the following modules, implemented over eight weeks:

1. **Data Collection (DC)**
2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing (DEP)**
3. **Model Building (MB)**
4. **Model Evaluation & Presentation (MEP)**

---

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Initial Exploration

- Utilized **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Pandas** for statistical analysis and data manipulation.
- Conducted initial data exploration to understand data distribution and variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Employed **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for data visualization.
- Created comprehensive visualizations to identify hidden patterns and insights.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Applied techniques like mean/median imputation and interpolation.
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Resolved inconsistencies and ensured data quality.
- **Encoding**: Performed nominal and ordinal encoding for categorical variables.
- **Outlier Detection**: Used Z-scores and IQR methods to identify and treat outliers.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed trends, seasonality, and randomness in the data.

---

## Modeling

### Baseline Models

- Established baseline models to serve as a benchmark.

### Advanced Models

- **Regression Models**: Random Forest and XGBoost provided superior performance for in-game score prediction.
- **Classification Models**: Implemented various algorithms to predict match winners.
- **Time Series Models**: Used ARIMA for forecasting player performance due to its effectiveness with limited data points.

### Model Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilized randomized grid search to optimize model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation**: Applied cross-validation to check for overfitting and ensure model generalizability.

### Inferencing and UI

- Saved encoded and pretrained models.
- Developed inferencing scripts for making predictions on new data.
- Created a user interface for model interaction.

---

## Results

Our advanced modeling approaches significantly outperformed the baseline models:

- **In-Game Score Prediction**: Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest and XGBoost regression models.
- **Winner Prediction**: Successfully predicted match outcomes using classification algorithms.
- **Player Performance Forecasting**: Effectively forecasted performance metrics using the ARIMA model.
